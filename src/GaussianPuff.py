        Inputs: 
            obs_dt [s] (scalar, double): 
                time interval (dt) for the observations
                NOTE: must be larger than sim_dt. This should be the resolution of the wind data.
            sim_dt [s] (scalar, double): 
                time interval (dt) for the simulation results
            puff_dt [s] (scalar, double): 
                time interval (dt) between two successive puffs' creation
                NOTE: must also be a positive integer multiple of sim_dt, e.g. puff_dt = n*sim_dt for integer n > 0
            output_dt [s] (scalar, double):
                resolution to resample the concentration to at the end of the sismulation. By default,
                resamples to the resolution of the wind observations obs_dt.
            simulation_start, simulation_end (pd.DateTime values)
                start and end times for the emission to be simulated.
            source_coordinates (array, size=(n_sources, 3)) [m]:
                holds source coordinate (x0,y0,z0) in meters for each source.
            emission_rates: (array, length=n_sources) [kg/hr]:
                rate that each source is emitting at in kg/hr.
            wind_speeds [m/s] (list of floats): 
                wind speed at each time stamp, in obs_dt resolution
            wind_directions [degree] (list of floats): 
                wind direction at each time stamp, in obs_dt resolution.
                follows the conventional definition: 
                0 -> wind blowing from North, 90 -> E, 180 -> S, 270 -> W
            using_sensors (boolean):
                If True, ignores grid-related input parameters and only simulates at sensor coordinates.
                True inputs:
                    - sensor_coordinates
                False inputs:
                    - grid_coordinates,
                    - nx, ny, nz
            sensor_coordinates: (array, size=(n_sensors, 3)) [m]
                coordinates of the sensors in (x,y,z) format.
            grid_coordinates: (array, length=6) [m]
                holds the coordinates for the corners of the rectangular grid to be created.
                format is grid_coordinates=[min_x, min_y, min_z, max_x, max_y, max_z]
            nx, ny, ny (scalar, int):
                Number of points for the grid the x, y, and z directions
            puff_duration (double) [seconds] :
                how many seconds a puff can 'live'; we assume a puff will fade away after a certain time.
                Depending on the grid size wind speed, this parameter will never come into play as the simulation
                for the puff stops when the plume has moved far away. In low wind speeds, however, this cutoff will
                halt the simulation of a puff early. This may be desirable as exceedingly long (and likely unphysical)
                plume departure times can be computed for wind speeds << 1 m/s
            exp_threshold_tolerance (scalar, float):
                the tolerance used to threshold the exponentials when evaluating the Gaussian equation.
                If, for example, exp_tol = 1e-9, the concentration at a single point for an individual time step
                will have error less than 1e-9. Upsampling to different time resolutions may introduce extra error.
                Default is 1e-7, which passess all safe-mode tests with less than 0.1% error. 
            conversion_factor (scalar, float): 
                convert from kg/m^3 to ppm, this factor is for ch4 only
            unsafe (boolean):
                if True, will use unsafe evaluations for some operations. This mode is faster but introduces some 
                error. If you're unsure about results, set to False and compare error between the two methods. 
            quiet (boolean): 
               if True, outputs extra information about the simulation and its progress.
